"""Tests for the daemon's pure free-ride credential handling.

The daemon NEVER refreshes the OAuth token — Claude Code (the token's owner) does
all refreshing; the daemon only reads whatever access token is currently stored and,
when it's dead, signals "No data" to the device. This replaces the old self-refresh
test suites (test_macos_refresh.py / test_windows_refresh.py), which covered machinery
that has been removed.

Run: python -m pytest tests/test_freeride.py -x -q
